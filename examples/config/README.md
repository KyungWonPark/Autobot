# config

Configuration is passing information neccesary for program to run.</br>
For example,
	- IP Address of database service to connect
	- ID and Password for database/API
	- Operation mode

One good way of delivering config info is to provide them by UNIX environment variable

# How to use
```bash
$ . ENV # Load environment variables into CMD
$ ./main # Run program
```
